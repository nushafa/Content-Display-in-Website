        Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a 
        usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often 
        various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which 
        is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes 
        called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
